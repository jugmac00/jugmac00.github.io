  <p>It all started with this error message:</p>
<pre><code> File "/Projects/xxx/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/flask_uploads.py", line 26, in &lt;module&gt;
from werkzeug import secure_filename, FileStorage
ImportError: cannot import name 'secure_filename' from 'werkzeug''
</code></pre>
<p>Trying to build my <code>Flask</code> application, the above error message was generated,
as <code>Werkzeug</code>, a very important library in the <code>Flask</code> ecosystem,
changed its API in version 1.0, back in February 2020.</p>
<p>This broke a lot of plugins.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1225758711009902592">Twitter thread</a></p>
<p>As my app relies on <code>Flask-Uploads</code>, I had a look at the problem
and finally provided a <a href="https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-uploads/pull/28">pull request</a>
to the <code>Flask-Uploads</code> repository on GitHub.</p>
<p>This pull request was merged, but the maintainer deliberately chose not to release a new version to PyPi,
though I even offered my help.</p>
<p>You can read his final argument here
<a href="https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-uploads/issues/29#issuecomment-614218327">https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-uploads/issues/29#issuecomment-614218327</a></p>
<p>The latest version on PyPi (0.2.1) is from 2016,
and that one does not work with a current Flask/Werkzeug version.</p>
<p>You certainly could pin <code>Flask-Uploads</code> to a GitHub commit ID.</p>
<p>I think this is inconvenient at least, and doing so caused me a lot of problems,
as pinning a GitHub commit ID worked on my dev machine, but Travis CI was broken.
For reasons.</p>
<p>While I finally managed it <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9895620/74611968-21140a00-5101-11ea-9280-4102f384b9a1.png">somehow</a>,
I felt a bit sad for all those developers asking for help and a new release.</p>
<p>Fast forward six months, there is still no new release.</p>
<p>I have thought about this situation a lot.
On the one hand, the GitHub repository is kinda up to date (the test suite is broken, and some more... ),
on the other hand there are many developers out there having trouble to fix their broken app.</p>
<p>So, yesterday I finally decided to fork this package,
and after fixing the test suite and some more housekeeping,
I released a new version to PyPi,
most importantly with a fix to the broken <code>Werkzeug</code> import - and tons more.</p>
<p>As only the original maintainer has access to <code>Flask-Uploads</code> on PyPi,
I had to create a new name:</p>
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Reuploaded/"><code>Flask-Reuploaded</code></a>.</p>
<p>One of my main goals is to stay compatible with <code>Flask-Uploads</code>.
It even is a drop-in replacement!</p>
<p>This means, instead of installing <code>Flask-Uploads</code>,
you only have to install <code>Flask-Reuploaded</code> and your migration work is finished.
You do not have to change a single line of code.</p>
<p>The package is found here
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Reuploaded/">https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Reuploaded/</a></p>
<p>And the repository is here
<a href="https://github.com/jugmac00/flask-reuploaded">https://github.com/jugmac00/flask-reuploaded</a></p>
<p>Speaking of repository, while I have fixed the broken test suite,
set up CI and more, there is still lots to do - especially beginner friendly tasks.
If you ever wanted to contribute to open source, why not to the library you use?
There are many <a href="https://github.com/jugmac00/flask-reuploaded/issues">open issues</a>.</p>
<p>When you now think... huh, this one guy... why should I use his package?
Maybe he is too busy soon, too?</p>
<p>The company I work for relies on <code>Flask-Reuploaded</code> - so there is big motivation to keep it working.
Also, I love Python and open source, and I am super open for other contributors.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, my dream would be a <code>Flask Umbrella</code> organization,
which the Flask plugin developers could join and share their workload more evenly.
See my proposal to the Pallets project here:
<a href="https://github.com/pallets/meta/issues/28">https://github.com/pallets/meta/issues/28</a></p>
<p>This all said...
I am super thankful to Max and all the other contributors to this and other open source packages.
I respect the decision not to release a package.
The beauty of open source is <strong>choice</strong>.
And now there is a choice when you want a working <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Reuploaded/">PyPi package</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
