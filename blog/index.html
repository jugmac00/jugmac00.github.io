  <blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> 
This post is not intended to be an exhaustive introduction to <code>pre-commit</code> and its hooks. Please visit <a href="https://pre-commit.com/">pre-commit.com</a> for a complete documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a nutshell...</p>
<h2>pre-commit</h2>
<p>From its <a href="https://pre-commit.com/">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very simplified this means, whenever you try to commit changes in your project (e.g. entering <code>git commit</code>), <code>pre-commit</code> runs all configured tools (e.g. linter, formatter, ...), and only if they run successfully, your commit will be executed - otherwise your commit will fail.</p>
<p>This is really great, as you will never ever forget to run your linter or other tools.</p>
<h2>isort</h2>
<p>One of those tools, which pre-commit can execute for you, is <code>isort</code> - short for "sort imports".</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this little helper sorts your import statements, both alphabetical and also PEP 8 compliant, means e.g. standard library imports are separated from the ones of third party tools. And I like this a lot!</p>
<p>A sample configuration for <code>pre-commit</code> to use <code>isort</code> could look like this - by the way, this is YAML:</p>
<pre><code>-   repo: https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort
    rev: 4.3.21
    hooks:
    -   id: isort
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you can customize <code>isort</code> to our liking, ie. every import on one line. This is just one of many configuration options.</p>
<p>And with the configuration options there comes the first problem.</p>
<h2>don't touch my migrations</h2>
<p>Whenever you run an application with a relational database, you probably also need to keep track of <code>migrations</code>, which usually consists of files with the diffs between two database schemes.</p>
<p>For my Flask app, those are stored in a subfolder called <code>migrations</code>.</p>
<p>No problem at all! Let's use <code>isort's</code> <code>skip</code> / <code>skip-glob</code> option (see  <code>isort's</code> <a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/wiki/isort-Settings">wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Looks easy enough.</p>
<p>After some <a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/282">googling</a> - my first try would be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[isort]
skip = migrations
</code></pre>
<p>Does not work. Hm, maybe I need to use globbing (wildcards)?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> 
I put <code>isort</code>'s configuration into my <code>tox.ini</code> file - you can certainly also use a dedicated <code>.isort.cfg</code> file. You'd have to replace the section <code>isort</code> with <code>settings</code> then.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After some more googling I came up with this:</p>
<pre><code>[isort]
skip_glob = */migrations/*.py
</code></pre>
<p>Guess what? This also does not work. All my migration files still get changed by <code>isort</code>.</p>
<p>After some more investigation, I found  <a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/885">https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/885</a>:</p>
<p>There is a new "never skip when passed a filename" behavior - which is... new. So, even if you put a file or a pattern into a <code>skip</code> option, it does not get skipped when passed to <code>isort</code> directly. And this is what I assume <code>pre-commit</code> is doing.</p>
<p>Ok, in the same issue a workaround was mentioned:
Use <code>--filter-files</code> on the command line, which I do not use, as I use <code>pre-commit</code>, but fortunately you can add it to your <code>pre-commit</code> hook configuration:</p>
<pre><code>  - repo: https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort
    rev: 4.3.21
    hooks:
    - id: isort
      args: [--filter-files]
</code></pre>
<p>It works!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> 
As an <a href="https://www.gitmemory.com/issue/pre-commit/mirrors-isort/9/511434587">alternative</a>, you could also add an <code>exclude: migrations/</code> statement in your pre-commit-config.yaml.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me rather say... it worked, until I updated from <code>4.3.21</code> to <code>4.3.21-2</code> - there are no changelog entries available for this update, but there were tons of changes, including different behavior which files should be scanned.</p>
<p>With this update, all files gets processed by <code>isort</code>, including <code>.po</code>, <code>.rst</code>, <code>.json</code> and many more.</p>
<p>Ok, what can we do about it?</p>
<p>First, file an issue (<a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/1154">https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/1154</a>).</p>
<p>Reading the excellent <code>pre-commit</code> documentation, it seems there are several options, but <a href="https://pre-commit.com/#creating-new-hooks"><code>filter by files</code></a> looks very promising.</p>
<p>The <code>files</code> statement supports regular expressions, so the new hook looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>  - repo: https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort
    rev: 4.3.21-2
    hooks:
    - id: isort
      args: [--filter-files]
      files: \.py$
</code></pre>
<p>And here we go... finally works as intended.</p>
<h2>post scriptum</h2>
<p>How does <code>isort</code> know how to sort the imports?</p>
<p>I don' t know, but it looks like Anthony Sottile knows a thing or two about this, and so he even wrote a tool which pre-polulates <code>isort's</code> <code>known_third_party</code> configuration, and thus makes <code>isort</code> even work better.</p>
<p>For more information and the <code>pre-commit</code> configuration please refer to <a href="https://github.com/asottile/seed-isort-config">https://github.com/asottile/seed-isort-config</a>.</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>I could track down the the faulty behavior (<code>isort</code> also touches files which are not Python files) to a regression/packaging bug - <code>.pre-commit-hook.yaml</code> is broken for 4.3.21-2 - see the issue at <code>isort</code>'s <a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/1154#issuecomment-587517806">bug tracker</a>.</p>

  </p>
  <p>The web application server <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zope">Zope</a> has a very long history which dates back to the late '90s.</p>
<p>Quoting <a href="https://twitter.com/faassen/status/1197219574711803905">Martijn Faassen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Zope must be one of the oldest Python codebases in the world that is still used outside the standard library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During its many years of existence the way a view gets rendered has changed.</p>
<p>Basically there are two supported template mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document Template Markup Language (DTML)</li>
<li>Zope Page Templates (ZPT)</li>
</ul>
<p>DTML is pretty much outdated for more than a decade, but still in use for the Zope Management Interface.</p>
<p>ZPTs are basically XML/HTML pages in which special markup is embedded (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_Attribute_Language">TAL</a>), which gets processed server side.</p>
<p>The processing is done by a template engine - this used to be the PageTemplateEngine.</p>
<p>With the release of Zope 4 this engine has been superseded by the <a href="https://github.com/malthe/chameleon">Chameleon</a> template engine, which is now activated per default.</p>
<p>While Chameleon offers more flexibility and better performance, there may be reasons(TM) for using the old template engine.</p>
<h2>word of caution</h2>
<p>As of using Zope 4.1, the old PageTemplateEngine currently works, but is deprecated and subject to be <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/104">removed anytime</a>.</p>
<h2>activate pageTemplateEngine</h2>
<p>True to the Python motto <strong>"There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it."</strong> there is no obvious,  but three rather obscure ways to get back the old engine - at least for the ZCML apprentice. <a href="https://docs.plone.org/develop/addons/components/zcml.html">ZCML</a> stands for Zope Configuration Mark-up Language.</p>
<p>ZCML was introduced with Zope 3, and is used to wire together different parts of your application.</p>
<h3>one</h3>
<p>Go to <code>src/Products/PageTemplates/configure.zcml</code> and comment out the configuration.</p>
<p>This can only be a temporary solution, as you should not modify an upstream package, e.g. Zope.</p>
<h3>two</h3>
<p>Make use of <a href="https://pypi.org/project/z3c.unconfigure/">z3c.unconfigure</a> and unconfigure the registration.</p>
<h3>three</h3>
<p>Create an <code>overrides.zcml</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
           xmlns:zcml="http://namespaces.zope.org/zcml"&gt;

  &lt;!-- This registration disables Chameleon templates on Zope 4. --&gt;
  &lt;utility
    zcml:condition="installed chameleon"
    component="zope.pagetemplate.pagetemplate.PageTemplateEngine" /&gt;

&lt;/configure&gt;
</code></pre>

  </p>
  <p>A couple of months ago, Brett Cannon, one of the better known Python core developers, announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/brettsky/status/1096578335428112384">Twitter</a> that he contributed to over 100 open source projects.</p>
<h2>first reaction</h2>
<p>Woohah! Congratulations!</p>
<h2>second reaction</h2>
<p>How did he know?</p>
<blockquote><p>Everytime I get a PR merged I record the repo's URL for a tool I created to analyze my contributions to OSS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah... k. I did not do that.</p>
<h2>third reaction</h2>
<p>To how many open source projects did I contribute? Well, I only started contributing recently, like one year ago or so... and as I said, I did not take any notes... but <strong>luckily</strong> nowadays like most open source development happens on Github. As far as I remember I only contributed to a couple projects which are not present on Github, and that was for <a href="https://bitbucket.org/flyingcircus/batou">batou</a> and <a href="http://trac.roundcube.net/">Roundcube</a>.</p>
<p>So, if only Github provided some API to query the data it stored about me... well, it does.</p>
<h2>say hello to graphql</h2>
<p><strong>GraphQL</strong> is a query language for web APIs. It was developed by Facebook, and according to rumors it will supersede REST in the near future.</p>
<p>Github kindly not only offers an API, but also an <a href="https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/">in-browser IDE</a> (based on <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a>) to explore the data.</p>
<h2>say hello to graphiql</h2>
<p>When you first hit Github's instance of GraphiQL ( <a href="https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/">https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/</a> ), you will see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="../blog/am-i-famous/github-graphiql-start.png" alt="Alt-Text"></p>
<p>So, obviously, first you have to login with your Github credentials (green "Sign in with Github" button in the top right).</p>
<h2>first encounter</h2>
<p>When I first saw this page, I played around a bit and left - as I did not get what I wanted. Luckily, at last weekend's <strong>PyConWeb19</strong>, Arthur Bayr did a workshop on <a href="https://pyconweb.com/talks/25-05-2019/introduction-to-graphql-and-graphene">GraphQL and Graphene</a> - thanks a ton!</p>
<p>Now I am ready to explore my data!</p>
<h2>overview</h2>
<p>On the top left, there is room to enter the query.</p>
<p>On the right, the result will be shown.</p>
<p>On the far right, there is the small, but super helpful <strong>Docs</strong> button.</p>
<p>On the bottom left is something I did not use yet.</p>
<h2>iteration one</h2>
<p>After you have logged in, leave the query as is...</p>
<pre><code>query { 
  viewer { 
    login
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>...  and just hit the play button above the "query field".</p>
<p>You should get a result similar to mine - but with your username</p>
<pre><code>{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "login": "jugmac00"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>explanation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>query</strong> outside the curly braces is just a name</li>
<li><strong>viewer</strong> is a data type, and it happens to be the currently authenticated in user</li>
<li><strong>login</strong> is a subfield of <strong>viewer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How do I know this?</p>
<p>On the far right, there is the <strong>Docs</strong> button. Small button, but lots and lots of information! Actually, you can explore the complete API when you open the docs and follow the links.</p>
<h2>iteration two</h2>
<p>Either by reading the docs or by hitting <strong>CTRL+SPACE</strong> which triggers autocompletion when you are in the query box, you will eventually come across a subfield with name <strong>repositoriesContributedTo</strong> - that sounds fine!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><br>
You cannot query arbitrary data - all fields, subfields, parameters... have to be defined by the API provider.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you just enter the following...</p>
<pre><code>query { 
  viewer {
    repositoriesContributedTo
  } 
}
</code></pre>
<p>... right below <strong>repostoriesContributetTo</strong> there will be a red squiggly line. When hover over the word, you can read "Field .. must have a selection of subfields".</p>
<p>Whatever! The cool thing.. if you hit the <strong>play</strong> button anyway, the IDE autocompletes your query to...</p>
<pre><code>query { 
  viewer {
    repositoriesContributedTo {
      edges {
        node {
          id
        }
      }
    }
  } 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The result is... hm... an error message: "You must provide a <code>first</code> or <code>last</code> value to properly paginate the <code>repositoriesContributedTo</code> connection."</p>
<p>Ok, let's do this.</p>
<h2>iteration three</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, it is a very good idea to force pagination on all APIs, which return lists - another thing I learned at PyConWeb19 - no slides, but there is a video from another conference: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSfE2rE3bM">Tech bankruptcy: Looking back on a decade of bad decision making</a></p>
<p>The mentioned <strong>value</strong> is actually a parameter, and parameters are put into parenthesis behind a (sub)fieldname, just like...</p>
<pre><code>query { 
  viewer {
    repositoriesContributedTo(first: 100) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
        }
      }
    }
  } 
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you only type <strong>first</strong>, you get a friendly reminder to provide a number, which must not be greater than 100.</p>
<p>The result...</p>
<pre><code>{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "repositoriesContributedTo": {
        "edges": [
          {
            "node": {
              "id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTI2NTQ="
            }
          },
...
</code></pre>
<p>... does not look to bad, but not very human readable.</p>
<h2>iteration four</h2>
<p>If you replace <strong>id</strong> with <strong>nameWithOwner</strong> (via API exploration STRG+SPACE or from the docs), you'll get much better data:</p>
<pre><code>query { 
  viewer {
    repositoriesContributedTo(first: 100) {
      edges {
        node {
          nameWithOwner
        }
      }
    }
  } 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The result...</p>
<pre><code>{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "repositoriesContributedTo": {
        "edges": [
          {
            "node": {
              "nameWithOwner": "python-babel/flask-babel"
            }
          },
          {
            "node": {
              "nameWithOwner": "malthe/chameleon"
            }
          },
...
</code></pre>
<p>But we want the total number of contributions.</p>
<h2>iteration five</h2>
<p>As I learned at the workshop, either the server or the client has to implement some count or sum functions, as you can only query what is offered (or process it client side).</p>
<p>So, let's have another look, what <strong>repositoriesContributedTo</strong> has to offer...</p>
<p>If you click on <strong>repositoriesContributedTo</strong> and then on <strong>RepositoryConnection!</strong> in the <strong>Docs</strong>, you'll see <strong>totalCount</strong> -  nice! And also, you'll see <strong>nodes</strong> - which can simplify the "first get all edges and then the corresponding nodes" syntax.</p>
<pre><code>query { 
  viewer {
    repositoriesContributedTo(first: 100) {
        totalCount
        nodes {
          nameWithOwner
      }
    }
  } 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The result...</p>
<pre><code>{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "repositoriesContributedTo": {
        "totalCount": 66,
        "nodes": [
          {
            "nameWithOwner": "python-babel/flask-babel"
          },
          {
            "nameWithOwner": "malthe/chameleon"
          },
...
</code></pre>
<p>Very nice.. except... also proprietary (private) repositories are listed...</p>
<h2>iteration six</h2>
<p>Visiting the docs again, <strong>repositoriesContributedTo</strong> offers a <strong>privacy</strong> parameter.</p>
<pre><code>query { 
  viewer {
    repositoriesContributedTo(first: 100, privacy: PUBLIC) {
        totalCount
        nodes {
          nameWithOwner
      }
    }
  } 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The final result...</p>
<pre><code>{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "repositoriesContributedTo": {
        "totalCount": 54,
        "nodes": [
          {
            "nameWithOwner": "python-babel/flask-babel"
          },
          {
            "nameWithOwner": "malthe/chameleon"
          },
...
</code></pre>
<h2>what's left</h2>
<p>First, once again, thank you very much Arthur for teaching me the basics of <strong>GraphQL</strong>!</p>
<p>Now it is up to the reader to explore the API further... oh wait.. what is the <strong>includeUserRepositories</strong> parameter doing...</p>
<p>Damn! I missed to include my very own projects! :-)</p>

  </p>
  <p>Concerning security and privacy, you either can get stalled because you can't get it perfect right from the beginning, or you improve over time.</p>
<p>I prefer the latter one. And concerning <strong>password security</strong> I go with Troy Hunt: <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-managers-dont-have-to-be-perfect-they-just-have-to-be-better-than-not-having-one/">Password managers don't have to be perfect, they just have to be better than not having one</a>.</p>
<p>And actually the password manager of a browser is already a password manager. I would not use it for very important passwords, but it is absolutely fine for those dozens of dozens forum logins and so on. Currently, I still manage the more important passwords with <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html">VeraCrypt</a> - which is not that comfortable, but does its job.</p>
<h2>works fine except when it does not</h2>
<p>So, Google Chrome's password manager works fine for me... except when it does not.</p>
<p>Chrome stopped showing the saved passwords - from one day to another. I can't recall whether it was the <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/upgrading-fedora-28-fedora-29/">Fedora 28 -&gt; 29 Upgrade</a> or maybe a Chrome update.</p>
<p>Anyway - it is extremely annoying to lookup passwords for every forum and and other sites which requires a login.</p>
<h2>the easy fix</h2>
<p>As I sync <del>everything</del> my profile with Google (hum, this sounds like something I should reevaluate some time) it is just a matter of deleting the broken profile and restarting <strong>Chrome</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>$ cd /home/jugmac00/.config
$ rm -rf google-chrome
</code></pre>
<p>It is as simple as that. And sure, I experience many more rough edges since I migrated to a Linux desktop, but I always feel like I keep the control and every problem is very easily fixable.</p>

  <p>This blog post is work in progess... much more to come - but the train is only 10 minutes late (uncommon in Germany :-) ) , so I am not able finish the blog post now.</p>
<h2>tl/dr - what a ride!</h2>
<ul>
<li>today there was the final release of Zope 4! see <a href="https://blog.gocept.com/2019/05/10/celebration-zope-4-final-release/">blog post @gocept</a></li>
<li>Michael / @gocept announced the <a href="https://blog.gocept.com/2019/05/10/zope-roadmap/">roadmap</a> for Zope 2.13, Zope 4 and Zope 5</li>
</ul>
<h2>progress on day 3</h2>
<p>The main effort of everybody at the sprint was to wrap up all loose ends, finalize what one started, and of course get Zope 4 final released!</p>
<p>As there was no final standup, I try to list what I picked up...</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael<ul>
<li>finish and publish the above mentioned blog posts</li>
<li>trying to not get lost with those massive incoming GitHub updates</li>
<li>preparing and finally publishing the release of Zope 4</li>
<li>had a deeper look into the "allowed attributes" ticket together with Steffen; a safe last minute fix was not possible</li>
<li>even found time to review some open pull requests and to give me a helping hand for a test setup</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jeremy<ul>
<li>finished enabling <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/zc.recipe.testrunner/pull/3">support for Python 3</a> for the zc.recipe.testrunner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steffen<ul>

</li>
<li>Jens Klein<ul>
<li>updated <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/608">ZODB migration story</a></li>
<li>oh noes! announced the news that <strong>Plone</strong> - for some cases - can't yet use <strong>Zope 4</strong> - info came from Philip Bauer, cf <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/610">ticket "allowed attributes"</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jens Hinghaus<ul>
<li>got his pull request merged for <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/605">fixing the ZMI serarch bug</a></li>

<p>This blog post tries to ease beginning and keeping up with development of the open source web application server <a href="https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Zope</a> and its universe.</p>
<h2>what makes it hard to start contributing to Zope</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zope</strong> is a very mature product, as it was launched already back in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zope">1999</a></li>
<li><strong>Zope</strong> underwent some major architectural changes (keyword <a href="http://muthukadan.net/docs/zca.html#introduction">ZCA</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Zope</strong> itself is relatively complex</li>
<li>there is also a complex ecosystem around it<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/">Buildout</a></li>
<li><a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation">GitHub.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tox</a> / <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-tox">quick introduction</a></li>
<li><a href="https://zopetestrunner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">zope.testrunner</a></li>
<li><a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a></li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>documentation is partially out of date (but there is an effort to fix this)</li>
<li>there are many developers which contribute for years, or even more than a decade, not many new developers</li>
<li>there are many <strong>unwritten</strong> rules</li>
</ul>
<h2>prerequisites</h2>
<p><strong>Zope</strong> and probably the most of its related packages are licensed under the <a href="https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:ZPL-2.1">ZPL</a>. In order to contribute to the project, you need to sign a <a href="http://docs.zope.org/developer/becoming-a-committer.html">contributor's agreement</a>. If you do not get a reply to your application in a reasonable amount of time, please resend your email.</p>
<h2>development process</h2>
<p>Once your application has been accepted, which is a mere formality, you may to start contributing.</p>
<h3>where to find the source code</h3>
<p>Zope and all its related packages, which reside under the umbrella of the Zope Foundation, are hosted at <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, the repository for Zope is located at <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope">https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope</a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong>  There are plans to merge the Zope Foundation into the <a href="https://plone.org/foundation">Plone Foundation</a> - current status is unknown.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>flow</h3>
<p>Though not 100% consistent, usually you cannot and you should not directly work on the master branch.</p>
<p>The recommended way is to clone the repository and work on a new branch.</p>
<p>Once finished, push your branch to the repository and create a pull request. Both your branch and the pull request will get automatically tested by TravisCI (see below).</p>
<p>Most repositories need both green tests and a successful review before a pull request gets merged.</p>
<p>Usually you will merge the branch yourself - in order to show off that you have signed the contributor agreement.</p>
<p>After the pull request had been merged, please delete your branch.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> If you want to implement very small changes - e.g. fixing typos - you can directly edit the file in your browser by clicking the pencil icon when viewing the file on GitHub.com.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>tests</h3>
<p>It is highly recommended that all code changes, bug fixes and new features should be tested by automatic tests.</p>
<p>Unlike most other Python projects, <strong>Zope/universe</strong> does not make use of pytest - which can be both quite surprising and a bit of a hurdle.</p>
<p><strong>Zope/universe</strong> makes heavily use of <a href="https://pypi.org/project/zope.testrunner/">zope.testrunner</a>.</p>
<h3>supported python versions</h3>
<p>Currently, Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 (dev) are supported for most of the <strong>Zope 4/universe</strong> packages. This reflects the officially supported Python versions.</p>
<p>Some packages also support <a href="https://pypy.org/">PyPy</a>.</p>
<p>Afaik, there are plans to drop support for Python 2.7 with Zope 5.</p>
<p>When adding support for a new Python version, or dropping support for an old one, you have to update several files:</p>
<ul>
<li>.travis.yml</li>
<li>tox.ini</li>
<li>setup.py</li>
<li>CHANGES.rst</li>
</ul>
<h3>continuous integration - mostly via travisci</h3>
<p>Whenever you push to a branch or make a pull request, <a href="https://travis-ci.org">TravisCI</a> automatically pulls your changes and runs the project's test suite.</p>
<p>This is configured via a <strong>.travis.yml</strong> file at root level of the repository.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong>  For packages, which should be supported on the Windows plattform, <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> gets used.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>travisci configuration</h3>
<p>The configuration for TravisCI changes on quite a regular basis. There are OS upgrades, new and deprecated Python versions, syntax changes and also new and deprecated features for Travis itself.</p>
<p>Depending on how the tests are run, whether there are checks for styles or coverage, the <strong>.travis.yml</strong> can be quite different for different packages.</p>
<p>You can have a look at the recently updated configuration for <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/zExceptions/blob/master/.travis.yml">zExceptions</a> as a good example with up-to-date best practices.</p>
<h3>deprecated travisci configuration</h3>
<p>If you happen to see a <strong>sudo: false/true</strong> option in a <strong>.travis.yml</strong> file, you can safely remove it (cf. <a href="https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-11-19-required-linux-infrastructure-migration">https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-11-19-required-linux-infrastructure-migration</a>).</p>
<h3>travisci trouble shooting</h3>
<ul>
<li>flaky tests - sometimes tests fail for <strong>no reason</strong> - you can try to dig deeper or just re-run the build by clicking the "rebuild" button on the TravisCI website.</li>
<li>bad cache =&gt; clear cache - rarely this is necessary; a re-run should do the job most of the time - please find more information at the <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching/#clearing-caches">TravisCI documentation site</a>.</li>
<li><strong>ImportError: libpython3.8m.so.1.0</strong>: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" =&gt; clear cache in TravisCI and restart build 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>1) Information by Dieter Maurer:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Python 3.8 problem was (likely) discussed in the Python mailing list today: the newest Python version has changed <strong>sys.implementation.cache_tag</strong> which prevents Python from finding shared objects installed for earlier versions. "pip" on the other hand seems not to take thin into account and thinks that the older version is still usable. Clearing the cache should fix the problem.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Although I started writing code already at the age of 13 (<strong>Generation C64</strong>), and I am a professional web and backend developer since 2007, I only started contributing to <strong>open source software</strong> quite recently - apart from the occasional bug report.</p>
<h2>what is open source software?</h2>
<p>Quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Open-source software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>interesting tidbit</h3>
<p>The term was coined by Tim O'Reilly, Eric Raymon and Bruce Perens in <strong>1998</strong> - that's just 20 years!</p>
<h2>why care about open source software?</h2>
<p>The company, I currently work for, makes heave use of open source sofware - maybe not right from the beginning, as the company predates the term open source software, but at least from the very start of the <strong>internet-age</strong>.</p>
<h3>utilized open source software (excerpt)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drupal / WordPress</li>
<li>Roundcube / Dovecot / Postfix</li>
<li>Apache / Nginx</li>
<li>PHP / Python</li>
<li>Linux!</li>
<li>and many more...</li>
</ul>
<h2>why would you not contribute to open source software?</h2>
<ul>
<li>work and family related time constraints</li>
<li>money - at least at work</li>
</ul>
<h2>turning point</h2>
<ul>
<li>among others, I am maintaining a 14 year old custom intranet application built on a Zope 2 / Python 2 stack</li>
<li>Python 2 support ends <a href="https://pythonclock.org/">01. January 2020</a></li>
<li>that means I have to migrate<ul>
<li>application server (Zope 2)</li>
<li>application itself</li>
<li>database (ZODB =&gt; a NoSQL database before the name was coined)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>resources - a team of one -&gt; <strong>mission impossible</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>... but ... Zope is open source software!</h2>
<ul>
<li>literally: the source code is <strong>open</strong> - available for everybody to read and modify, so no legal restrictions</li>
<li>but that does not mean there is no business interest/money involved</li>

<p>Despite its <del>age</del> maturity <strong>Zope</strong> is still widely used, indirectly by the very popular and rock stable CMS <a href="https://plone.org/">Plone</a>, but also for big custom applications, for instance <strong>union.cms</strong>, which gets used by <a href="https://www.verdi.de/">ver.di</a> and <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Gewerkschaftsbund">DGB</a>.</p>
<p>That means that there is a broad interest of companies and unions alike to keep Zope going.</p>
<p>Focussing on the core competence, it is not always the best idea to employ software engineers yourself - at least not to build on the basis technology.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are quite some consultants out there working with the Zope / Plone universe, e.g. <a href="https://gocept.com/"><strong>gocept gmbh &amp; co. kg</strong></a>, which get hired by companies and the mentioned unions, in order to work on Zope. <strong>gocept</strong> on the other hand also has great interest in <strong>Zope's</strong> future, and therefore also heavily contributes back to the <strong>Zope</strong> universe, both with code contributions, but they also host so called <strong>sprints</strong>.</p>
<p>Sounds like a win win win situation!</p>
<h3>sprint what?</h3>
<p>A sprint is a set period of time during all kind of software developers come together to work on a certain project. In this case, the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Zope-Sprint/">migration of Zope from Python 2.7 to Python 3</a>.</p>

<h2>one last thing</h2>
<p>Contributing to open source software should not exclusively be at the expense of your free time!</p>
<p>Ask your boss - today! Eventually, you'll be surprised - so was I.</p>
