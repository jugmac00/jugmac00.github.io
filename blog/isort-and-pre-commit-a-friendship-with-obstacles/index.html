  <blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> 
This post is not intended to be an exhaustive introduction to <code>pre-commit</code> and its hooks. Please visit <a href="https://pre-commit.com/">pre-commit.com</a> for a complete documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a nutshell...</p>
<h2>pre-commit</h2>
<p>From its <a href="https://pre-commit.com/">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very simplified this means, whenever you try to commit changes in your project (e.g. entering <code>git commit</code>), <code>pre-commit</code> runs all configured tools (e.g. linter, formatter, ...), and only if they run successfully, your commit will be executed - otherwise your commit will fail.</p>
<p>This is really great, as you will never ever forget to run your linter or other tools.</p>
<h2>isort</h2>
<p>One of those tools, which pre-commit can execute for you, is <code>isort</code> - short for "sort imports".</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this little helper sorts your import statements, both alphabetical and also PEP 8 compliant, means e.g. standard library imports are separated from the ones of third party tools. And I like this a lot!</p>
<p>A sample configuration for <code>pre-commit</code> to use <code>isort</code> could look like this - by the way, this is YAML:</p>
<pre><code>-   repo: https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort
    rev: 4.3.21
    hooks:
    -   id: isort
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you can customize <code>isort</code> to our liking, ie. every import on one line. This is just one of many configuration options.</p>
<p>And with the configuration options there comes the first problem.</p>
<h2>don't touch my migrations</h2>
<p>Whenever you run an application with a relational database, you probably also need to keep track of <code>migrations</code>, which usually consists of files with the diffs between two database schemes.</p>
<p>For my Flask app, those are stored in a subfolder called <code>migrations</code>.</p>
<p>No problem at all! Let's use <code>isort's</code> <code>skip</code> / <code>skip-glob</code> option (see  <code>isort's</code> <a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/wiki/isort-Settings">wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Looks easy enough.</p>
<p>After some <a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/282">googling</a> - my first try would be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[isort]
skip = migrations
</code></pre>
<p>Does not work. Hm, maybe I need to use globbing (wildcards)?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> 
I put <code>isort</code>'s configuration into my <code>tox.ini</code> file - you can certainly also use a dedicated <code>.isort.cfg</code> file. You'd have to replace the section <code>isort</code> with <code>settings</code> then.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After some more googling I came up with this:</p>
<pre><code>[isort]
skip_glob = */migrations/*.py
</code></pre>
<p>Guess what? This also does not work. All my migration files still get changed by <code>isort</code>.</p>
<p>After some more investigation, I found  <a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/885">https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/885</a>:</p>
<p>There is a new "never skip when passed a filename" behavior - which is... new. So, even if you put a file or a pattern into a <code>skip</code> option, it does not get skipped when passed to <code>isort</code> directly. And this is what I assume <code>pre-commit</code> is doing.</p>
<p>Ok, in the same issue a workaround was mentioned:
Use <code>--filter-files</code> on the command line, which I do not use, as I use <code>pre-commit</code>, but fortunately you can add it to your <code>pre-commit</code> hook configuration:</p>
<pre><code>  - repo: https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort
    rev: 4.3.21
    hooks:
    - id: isort
      args: [--filter-files]
</code></pre>
<p>It works!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> 
As an <a href="https://www.gitmemory.com/issue/pre-commit/mirrors-isort/9/511434587">alternative</a>, you could also add an <code>exclude: migrations/</code> statement in your pre-commit-config.yaml.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me rather say... it worked, until I updated from <code>4.3.21</code> to <code>4.3.21-2</code> - there are no changelog entries available for this update, but there were tons of changes, including different behavior which files should be scanned.</p>
<p>With this update, all files gets processed by <code>isort</code>, including <code>.po</code>, <code>.rst</code>, <code>.json</code> and many more.</p>
<p>Ok, what can we do about it?</p>
<p>First, file an issue (<a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/1154">https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/1154</a>).</p>
<p>Reading the excellent <code>pre-commit</code> documentation, it seems there are several options, but <a href="https://pre-commit.com/#creating-new-hooks"><code>filter by files</code></a> looks very promising.</p>
<p>The <code>files</code> statement supports regular expressions, so the new hook looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>  - repo: https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort
    rev: 4.3.21-2
    hooks:
    - id: isort
      args: [--filter-files]
      files: \.py$
</code></pre>
<p>And here we go... finally works as intended.</p>
<h2>post scriptum</h2>
<p>How does <code>isort</code> know how to sort the imports?</p>
<p>I don' t know, but it looks like Anthony Sottile knows a thing or two about this, and so he even wrote a tool which pre-polulates <code>isort's</code> <code>known_third_party</code> configuration, and thus makes <code>isort</code> even work better.</p>
<p>For more information and the <code>pre-commit</code> configuration please refer to <a href="https://github.com/asottile/seed-isort-config">https://github.com/asottile/seed-isort-config</a>.</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>I could track down the the faulty behavior (<code>isort</code> also touches files which are not Python files) to a regression/packaging bug - <code>.pre-commit-hook.yaml</code> is broken for 4.3.21-2 - see the issue at <code>isort</code>'s <a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/1154#issuecomment-587517806">bug tracker</a>.</p>
