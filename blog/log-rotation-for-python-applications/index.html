The cache of my app is cold, that means that my colleagues get slow response times for the first queries in the morning.  What’s wrong? Thanks to version controlled configuration management it was not hard to pick up a trail of the problem.\nThe commit which looked most promising was one about introducing proper log rotation with Logrotate.\nLogrotate manages automatic rotation and compression of your log files.\nLog rotation was setup to send a signal to Zope to close and re-open the log file as following:\n/srv/app/deployment/work/zope/var/log/instance*.log { postrotate kill -USR2 $(cat /srv/app/deployment/work/zope/var/instance/Z4.pid) endscript } kill sounds scary at first, but it isn’t, or let’s say, it shouldn’t be.\nIt just sends a signal to a process - and USR2 happens to be a signal for which your application can use a customized reaction, e.g. log close and re-open.\nLooking at Zope’s documentation, this is exactly how it should look like and it definitely used to work this way back then with Zope 2. No mentions in the Zope documentation about a change.\nSIGUSR2 close and re-open all Zope log files (z2.log, event log, detailed log.) The common idiom after rotating Zope log files is:: kill -USR2 `cat $ZOPE_HOME/var/Z2.pid` This excerpt was available under https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html - meanwhile it was updated.\nSo, this looks like a Zope bug, eh?\nMinimal setup to reproduce it… yep, Zope dies.\nSome back and forth between Zope’s and Waitress' (WSGI server) maintainers about who should fix this, and… there is nothing to fix.\nZope decided to drop signal handling with the 2 to 4 update, and Waitress can’t do it as it does not handle log files.\nExcuse me, sir. What is the real problem here? When Logrotate archives the current log file, and creates a new one, the current app’s process keeps the handle to the original file, and keeps logging into it, although there is a new one.\nUsually, you can restart your app or send a special signal, like USR2 to your app to fix this problem, but as outlined above, both options do not work out great with my use case.\nSo, what to do? Turns out, there are many options!\n log to a supervising process use Logrotate’s copytruncate directive use Python’s WatchedFileHandler  Having used Python for more than a decade, I still get surprised by gems in the standard library I never heard of before. Just like the WatchedFileHandler.\nWhile all three options are valid, the WatchedFileHandler just does what is needed here. Watch the file for a change, then close the old file stream and open a new one.\nThe final “configuration” of Logrotate is this simple:\n/srv/app/deployment/work/zope/var/log/*.log { } ","wordCount":"494","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-04-08T14:20:11+02:00","dateModified":"2020-04-08T14:20:11+02:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://jugmac00.github.io/blog/log-rotation-for-python-applications/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jürgen Gmach","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://jugmac00.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:#1d1e20;--entry:#2e2e33;--primary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg:#2e2e33;--code-bg:#37383e;--border:#333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://jugmac00.github.io accesskey=h title="Jürgen Gmach (Alt + H)">Jürgen Gmach</a>
