  <p>A couple of days after a successful deployment of my <a href="https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Zope 4</a> application, I noticed something worrisome.</p>
<p>Zope gets killed every night, shortly after midnight.</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://supervisord.org/">Supervisor</a>, which monitors the process and restarts it, so that's not the problem.</p>
<p>But there are two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>I did not trigger this on purpose.</li>
<li>The cache of my app is cold, that means that my colleagues get slow response times for the first queries in the morning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's wrong?</h2>
<p>Thanks to version controlled <a href="https://batou.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">configuration management</a> it was not hard to pick up a trail of the problem.</p>
<p>The commit which looked most promising was one about introducing proper log rotation with <code>Logrotate</code>.</p>
<p><code>Logrotate</code> manages automatic rotation and compression of your log files.</p>
<p>Log rotation was setup to send a signal to Zope to close and re-open the log file as following:</p>
<pre><code>/srv/app/deployment/work/zope/var/log/instance*.log  {

postrotate
kill -USR2 $(cat /srv/app/deployment/work/zope/var/instance/Z4.pid)
endscript
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>kill</code> sounds scary at first, but it isn't, or let's say, it shouldn't be.</p>
<p>It just sends a signal to a process - and <code>USR2</code> happens to be a signal for which your application can use a customized reaction, e.g. log close and re-open.</p>
<p>Looking at Zope's documentation, this is exactly how it should look like - and it definitely used to work this way back then with Zope 2. No mentions in the Zope documentation about a change.</p>
<pre><code>SIGUSR2
  close and re-open all Zope log files (z2.log, event log, detailed log.) The
  common idiom after rotating Zope log files is::

    kill -USR2 `cat $ZOPE_HOME/var/Z2.pid`
</code></pre>
<p>This excerpt was available under <a href="https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html">https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html</a> - meanwhile it was updated.</p>
<p>So, this looks like a Zope bug, eh?</p>
<p>Minimal setup to reproduce it... yep, Zope dies.</p>
<p>Some back and forth between Zope's and Waitress' (WSGI server) maintainers about who should fix this, and... there is nothing to fix.</p>
<p><strong>Zope decided to drop signal handling</strong> with the 2 to 4 update, and Waitress can't do it as it does not handle log files.</p>
<h2>Excuse me, sir. What is the real problem here?</h2>
<p>When <code>Logrotate</code> archives the current log file, and creates a new one, the current app's process keeps the handle to the original file, and keeps logging into it, although there is a new one.</p>
<p>Usually, you can restart your app or send a special signal, like USR2 to your app to fix this problem, but as outlined above, both options do not work out great with my use case.</p>
<h2>So, what to do?</h2>
<p>Turns out, there are many options!</p>
<ul>
<li>log to a supervising process</li>
<li>use <code>Logrotate</code>'s <a href="https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/logrotate.8#Files_and_Folders"><code>copytruncate</code></a> directive </li>
<li>use Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#watchedfilehandler"><code>WatchedFileHandler</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Having used Python for more than a decade, I still get surprised by gems in the standard library I never heard of before. Like the <code>WatchedFileHandler</code>.</p>
<p>While all three options are valid, the <code>WatchedFileHAndler</code> just does what is needed here. Watch the file for a change, then close the old file stream and open a new one.</p>
<p>The final "configuration" of <code>Logrotate</code> is this simple:</p>
<pre><code>/srv/app/deployment/work/zope/var/log/*.log  {

}
</code></pre>
