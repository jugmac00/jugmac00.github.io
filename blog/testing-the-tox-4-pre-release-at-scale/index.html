  <p>Every once in a while,
you may read that one of your favorite used packages announces an new version.</p>
<p>Sometimes even a so-called alpha version is announced.</p>
<p>The maintainers then politely ask you, the user, to test the package,
and give feedback if anything is broken.</p>
<p>When the upcoming <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/">pytest</a> version 6 had been announced,
I wrote a short instruction on how to
<a href="https://github.com/jugmac00/til/blob/master/python/install-release-candidates.md">install pre-releases</a>.</p>
<p>This time, <a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tox</a>,
the <strong>virtualenv</strong> management and test tool,
announced a new version 4, but it is not just a new version,
it is a complete rewrite by <a href="https://twitter.com/gjbernat">Bernát Gábor</a>!</p>
<p>So, if you use <strong>tox</strong>, and you certainly should,
testing your package with <strong>tox 4 alpha</strong> is highly recommended.</p>
<p>Stop reading now, and try it - I am serious!</p>
<p>I did test an early alpha version,
and found quite a couple of issues for the projects I maintain (
<a href="https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1781">1</a>
<a href="https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1782">2</a>
<a href="https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1783">3</a>
<a href="https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1804">4</a>
<a href="https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1859">5</a>
<a href="https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1868">6</a>
).</p>
<p>They were all addressed in no time.</p>
<p>This is important both for you,
so you can use the new version once it gets released without a hassle,
and also for the maintainer,
who does not get stressed out completely on the day the new package gets released.</p>
<p>End of story...</p>
<p>Not yet!</p>
<h2>alpha testing on scale</h2>
<p>Maybe you know that I am contributor to the <a href="https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Zope project</a>.
Zope is the bedrock of Python web frameworks.
And while development has come to a <em>sustainable</em> path, it is still used out in the wild.</p>
<p>One characteristic, which I miss for other projects is,
that not only the core project,
but also hundreds and hundreds of plugins are managed together in one <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation">GitHub organization</a>.</p>
<p>I mentioned the advantages already a couple of times.</p>
<p>All contributors can access all packages, fix minor issues,
which means, no package is left behind,
and no package depends of the good will of a single maintainer,
who always start euphoric,
and at one point in time neglect the project because of real life or switching company or language.</p>
<p>Ok, so we use <strong>tox</strong> in most of the roundabout 300 active packages.</p>
<p>How would I be able to run <strong>tox alpha</strong> on all of them?</p>
<h2>all-repos to the rescue</h2>
<p>I already wrote about <a href="https://github.com/asottile/all-repos">all-repos</a>
by <a href="https://twitter.com/codewithanthony">Anthony Sottile</a> previously in
<a href="https://jugmac00.github.io/blog/how-to-create-hundreds-of-pull-requests-with-a-single-command/">How to create hundreds of pull requests with a single command?</a>,
but this time it is different.</p>
<p>If you did not encounter <strong>all-repos</strong> yet...</p>
<p>In short, with <strong>all-repos</strong> you can clone all of your and your organization's repositories,
find files,
grep in them,
mass apply changes to them and finally create pull requests,
all from the command line.</p>
<p>But afaik <strong>all-repos</strong> does not offer an easy way to run a custom command on all repositories.</p>
<p>Also, unlike e.g. <strong>pytest</strong>, it also does not offer a plugin mechanism, but ...</p>
<p>It is super easy to use <strong>all-test</strong> as a library.</p>
<h2>use the source</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://github.com/asottile/all-repos/blob/master/README.md">README</a> offers a nice overview of the API,
I directly dug into the source code to find some inspiration on how to write my custom <strong>all-repos</strong> command line script.</p>
<p><strong>all-repos</strong> offers a couple of command line entry points
and also a couple of <a href="https://github.com/asottile/all-repos/tree/master/all_repos/autofix">example usages</a>,
and after looking around a bit,
I chose the script for <a href="https://github.com/asottile/all-repos/blob/master/all_repos/list_repos.py">all-repos-list-repos</a>,
which basically does everything I wanted,
except executing <strong>tox</strong>.</p>
<p>So, <strong>all-repos</strong> exposes a <code>load_config</code> method,
with which I get hold on all repositories,
and instead of just printing their paths,
I need to check whether they contain a <strong>tox.ini</strong> file,
and if so, run <strong>tox4 alpha</strong>.</p>
<p>After that I check the return code of <strong>tox</strong>.
If the run succeeds, and it does for <strong>tox3</strong> otherwise our CI would not be green,
all is ok, otherwise I need to collect the repo name for later inspection.</p>
<p>At the end I just print the result.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">config = load_config(args.config_filename)
results = {
    &quot;notox&quot;: [],
    &quot;successful&quot;: [],
    &quot;problems&quot;: [],
}

number_of_repos = len(config.get_cloned_repos())

for i, repo in enumerate(list(config.get_cloned_repos())):
    path_repo = os.path.join(config.output_dir, repo)
    path_tox = os.path.join(path_repo, &quot;tox.ini&quot;)
    if os.path.exists(path_tox):
        print(f&quot;about to run tox for {repo}, {i+1} of {number_of_repos}&quot;)
        run = subprocess.run([&quot;tox4&quot;, &quot;-e py38&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, path_tox], stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        if run.returncode == 0:
            print(f&quot;tox4 run successful for {repo}&quot;)
            results[&quot;successful&quot;].append(repo)
        else:
            print(f&quot;tox4 run failed for {repo}&quot;)
            results[&quot;problems&quot;].append(repo)

    else:
        results[&quot;notox&quot;].append(repo)
        print(f&quot;{repo} does not contain a tox configuration. Boo!&quot;)

print(f&#39;notox: {len(results[&quot;notox&quot;])}&#39;)
print(f&#39;{results[&quot;notox&quot;]}&#39;)
print(f&#39;successful: {len(results[&quot;successful&quot;])}&#39;)
print(f&#39;{results[&quot;successful&quot;]}&#39;)
print(f&#39;problems: {len(results[&quot;problems&quot;])}&#39;)
print(f&#39;{results[&quot;problems&quot;]}&#39;)
</code></pre>
<p>(I will create a repository for the complete script once I cleaned it up,
and documented it properly.)</p>
<p>The end...?</p>
<p>Not yet...</p>
<h2>real life issues</h2>
<p>Super easy, right?</p>
<p>Yep, except after quite some time, my Ubuntu machine got completely unresponsive.</p>
<p>Not even keyboard presses gave any reaction...</p>
<p>After a hard reset, I inspected <strong>syslog</strong>,
and found out that my machine ran out of memory and started killing processes.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>I had another look at my script and still had no clue.</p>
<p>I asked at the <a href="https://discord.gg/tox">tox discord channel</a>,
and both Anthony and Bernát gave me some valuable tips,
I ran my script again,
and after quite some time again, it made boom again.</p>
<p>Finally, I pinpointed the problem to a single repository,
which for some yet to be investigated reasons,
started an endless <strong>setuptools</strong> update circle and ate memory like crazy.</p>
<p>After I excluded this one repository,
my script finally completed,
and showed me the result.</p>
<blockquote><p>tox 4 alpha 6 on 288 Zope repositories, 17 without tox, 62 successful, 208 broken builds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bernát's reaction: "a 22% success here, not that great news :smile: but on plus side seems if we fix zope we should be in a decent place"</p>
<p>That was my intention! :-)</p>
<p>P.S.: By the way, there are certainly not 208 different errors / bugs,
it is more like there are roundabout four different error cases,
which I will have a look at myself at first,
and when it turns out this is not a problem in the package,
I will report an issue at the issue tracker of tox.</p>
<h2>thanks</h2>
<p>Thanks to Anthony and Bernát for all your work in the Python open source eco system,
and for always being friendly and helpful!</p>
<h2>found and reported issues</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.testrunner/issues/112"><code>package init file missing</code> warning when running tox4</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I will update this list with all the reported issues, be it at the tox or the project's issue tracker.</p>
