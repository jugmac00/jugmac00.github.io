Zope is the bedrock of Python web frameworks. And while development has come to a sustainable path, it is still used out in the wild.\nOne characteristic, which I miss in other projects, is that not only the core project, but also hundreds and hundreds of plugins are managed together in one GitHub organization.\nI mentioned the advantages already a couple of times.\nAll contributors can access all packages, fix minor issues, which means no package is left behind, and no package depends on the good will of a single maintainer, who always starts euphoric, and at one point in time neglects the project because of real life or switching company or language.\nOk, so we use tox in most of the roundabout 300 active packages.\nHow would I be able to run tox alpha on all of them?\nall-repos to the rescue I already wrote about all-repos by Anthony Sottile previously in How to create hundreds of pull requests with a single command?, but this time it is different.\nIf you have not encountered all-repos yet…\nIn short, with all-repos you can clone all of your and your organization’s repositories, find files, grep in them, mass apply changes to them and finally create pull requests, all from the command line.\nBut afaik all-repos does not offer an easy way to run a custom command on all repositories.\nAlso, unlike e.g. pytest, it also does not offer any plugin mechanism, but …\nIt is super easy to use all-repos as a library.\nuse the source While the README offers a nice overview of the API, I directly dug into the source code to find some inspiration on how to write my custom all-repos command line script.\nall-repos offers a couple of command line entry points and also a couple of example usages, and after looking around a bit, I chose the script for all-repos-list-repos as a template, which basically does everything I wanted, except executing tox.\nSo, all-repos exposes a load_config method, with which I get hold of all repositories, and instead of just printing their paths as in all-repos-list-repos, I need to check whether they contain a tox.ini file, and if so, run tox4 alpha.\nAfter that I check the return code of tox. If the run succeeds, and it does for tox3 otherwise our CI would not be green, all is ok, otherwise I need to collect the repo name for later inspection.\nAt the end I just print the result.\nfirst version of the script def main(argv: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None) - int: parser = argparse.ArgumentParser( description='Run tox4 on all cloned repositories.', usage='python main.py -C configfile', ) cli.add_common_args(parser) cli.add_output_paths_arg(parser) args = parser.parse_args(argv) config = load_config(args.config_filename) results = {\"notox\": [], \"successful\": [], \"problems\": [], } for i, repo in enumerate(config.get_cloned_repos()): path_repo = os.path.join(config.output_dir, repo) path_tox = os.path.join(path_repo, \"tox.ini\") if os.path.exists(path_tox): print(f\"about to run tox for {repo}, {i+1} of {len(config.get_cloned_repos())}\") run = subprocess.run([\"tox4\", \"-e py39\", \"-c\", path_tox], capture_output=\"True\") if run.returncode == 0: print(f\"tox4 run successful for {repo}\") results[\"successful\"].append(repo) else: print(f\"tox4 run failed for {repo}\") results[\"problems\"].append(repo) else: results[\"notox\"].append(repo) print(f\"{repo} does not contain a tox configuration. Boo!\") print(results) return 0 The latest version of the script is available on GitHub.\nThe end…?\nNot yet…\nreal life issues Super easy, right?\nYep, except after quite some time, my Ubuntu machine got completely unresponsive.\nNot even keyboard presses gave any reaction…\nAfter a hard reset, I inspected syslog, and found out that my machine ran out of memory and started killing processes.\nBut why?\nI had another look at my script and still had no clue.\nI asked at the tox discord channel, and both Anthony and Bernát gave me some valuable tips on how to improve my code.\nI ran my script again, and after quite some time it made boom again.\nFinally, with the help of a system monitoring tool, I pinpointed the problem to a single repository, which for some yet to be investigated reasons, started an endless setuptools update circle and ate memory like crazy.\nAfter I excluded this one repository, my script finally completed, and showed me the result.\n tox 4 alpha 6 on 288 Zope repositories, 17 without tox, 62 successful, 208 broken builds\n Bernát’s reaction:\n “a 22% success here, not that great news :smile: but on plus side seems if we fix zope we should be in a decent place”\n This was exactly my intention! :-)\nP.S.: By the way, there are certainly not 208 different errors / bugs, there are quite some repeating errors, which I will have a look at myself at first, and when it turns out this is not a problem in the package, I will report an issue in the issue tracker of tox.\nthanks Thanks to Anthony and Bernát for all your work in the Python open source eco system, and for always being friendly and helpful!\nfound and reported issues  package init file missing warning when running tox4 tox4: fails when requirements file contains a line a la -e .[test] -c constraints.xt tox is broken #24 tox4: tox fails to parse tox.ini when a testenv contains deps = .[test] tox broken #114 tox broken #14 tox will break with the release of tox4 #18 tox run broken #80 tox broken: “ImportError: No module name zope.testrunner #74 tox configuration is Python 2.7 only #6 tox4: ValueError: No closing quotation (via shlex) #1944 tox4: editable installs do not work (deps) #1945 tox will break when tox4 will be released #48 tox4: a possible quoting issue #1948 tox is broken: couldn’t open …buildout.cfg #52 no support for Python 3.8 - module cgi has no attribute escape #8 ResourceWarning: Enable tracemalloc to get the object allocation traceback  updates 2021-04\n Meanwhile something crazy happened - Bernát asked me to join the tox maintainer team!

and both Anthony and Bernát gave me some valuable tips on how to improve my code.</p><p>I ran my script again,
and after quite some time it made boom again.</p><p>Finally, with the help of a system monitoring tool,
I pinpointed the problem to a single repository,
which for some yet to be investigated reasons,
started an endless <strong>setuptools</strong> update circle and ate memory like crazy.</p><p>After I excluded this one repository,
my script finally completed,
and showed me the result.</p><blockquote><p>tox 4 alpha 6 on 288 Zope repositories, 17 without tox, 62 successful, 208 broken builds</p></blockquote><p>Bernát&rsquo;s reaction:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;a 22% success here, not that great news :smile: but on plus side seems if we fix zope we should be in a decent place&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>This was exactly my intention! :-)</p><p>P.S.: By the way, there are certainly not 208 different errors / bugs,
there are quite some repeating errors,
which I will have a look at myself at first,
and when it turns out this is not a problem in the package,
I will report an issue in the issue tracker of tox.</p><h2 id=thanks>thanks<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#thanks>#</a></h2><p>Thanks to Anthony and Bernát for all your work in the Python open source eco system,
