  <p>For simplicity, let's the call the app <strong>Dated HR</strong>,
a tool to "Simplify your HR work",
which offers support for time tracking, holiday, payroll...</p>
<p>So far so good, and even better,
as it is an enterprisy Windows software,
which needs to be configured with <strong>IIS</strong> and a <strong>MSSQL</strong> database,
a colleague of mine installed it on an internal Windows server.</p>
<p>The app makes a web GUI available under <a href="http://nemesis.company.local">http://nemesis.company.local</a>,
which would work like a charm - for our colleagues at site,
but not for the colleagues from the other sites.</p>
<p>But certainly, it is 2020, you want encryption via https,
and also the other colleagues need web access.</p>
<p>Setting up <strong>nginx</strong> as reverse proxy is business as usual.</p>
<p>Also, adding https via <strong>Certbot</strong> can't get much simpler:
<a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">https://certbot.eff.org/</a></p>
<p>So far, so good, the app is now available via
<a href="https://hr.company.com">https://hr.company.com</a></p>
<p>The app seems to work,
but when clicking on a special button
(I refrain from calling it a link,
as it is a humongous JavaScripty-eventlistener-from-data-attribute-fetching something),
I get a ...</p>
<p><code>This site cannot be reached" nemesis.company.local’s server IP address could not be found.</code></p>
<p>Having a look at the HTML source,
a wild mix of relative and absolute URLs show up,
where the latter have <code>http://nemesis.company.local</code> hardcoded.</p>
<p>If this was an open source app, I could</p>
<ul>
<li>read the documentation on the internet</li>
<li>have a look in the source code</li>
<li>have a look at the issue tracker</li>
<li>search on Stack Overflow</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>...but... did I mention it is an <strong>enterprisy</strong> app?</p>
<p>So, let's tell the Windows admin to configure the app properly.</p>
<p>Turns out, there is no option.</p>
<p>Asking vendor for support also did not work out:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reported behavior cannot be changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, maybe you cannot... but I can - possibly.</p>
<p><strong>nginx</strong>, my favorite web server,
can rewrite HTML on the fly,
via the <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_sub_module.html">http_sub_module</a>.</p>
<p>While this module is not compiled into <strong>nginx</strong> by default,
luckily the <strong>Ubuntu</strong> developers included it.</p>
<p>So, adding the following snippet to my location block should do the trick...</p>
<pre><code>sub_filter 'http://nemesis.company.local' 'https://$host';
sub_filter_once off;
</code></pre>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li>the first directive replaces the local host name with the one of the reverse proxy</li>
<li>and the second one makes sure every occurrence gets replaced</li>
</ul>
<p>After restarting <strong>nginx</strong>,
I still get the same error. <strong>bummer</strong>.</p>
<p>I double checked,
no more occurrences in the generated HTML, CSS or JavaScript...</p>
<p>Hm, let's have a look at the <strong>HTTP headers</strong> in the debug console.</p>
<p>Here we go, the <code>location</code> header of the response had the following value...</p>
<p><code>http://nemesis.company.lcoal/.../.../.../.../Default.aspx</code></p>
<p>Once more, after some googling,
the <strong>nginx</strong> documentation offered a solution
via the <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_redirect">proxy_redirect directive</a>.</p>
<p>While <code>proxy_redirect</code> sounds a bit odd,
the description makes more sense:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sets the text that should be changed in the "Location" and "Refresh" header fields of a proxied server response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very nice, let's add the following snippet to my location block...</p>
<pre><code>proxy_redirect http://nemesis.company.local https://$host;
</code></pre>
<p>After restarting <strong>nginx</strong> once more,
everything works as intended!</p>
<p>The complete location block looks like...</p>
<pre><code>location / {
    proxy_pass http://nemesis.company.local:80/;
    sub_filter 'http://nemesis.company.local' 'https://$host';
    sub_filter_once off;
    proxy_redirect http://nemesis.company.local https://$host;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the enterprisy app works like a charm - thanks to <strong>open source</strong>!</p>
<p>P.S.: While debugging the errors,
I found several seriously outdated JS libraries with some known <strong>CVE</strong> entries.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the vendor's answer!</p>
<p>At very least the developers of this very app show good humor,
as they named the variables after cocktails,
which I can relate to.</p>
<p>Cheers! Prost! Na zdraví!</p>
