What is Open Source Supply Chain? Most applications nowadays use open source libraries, especially for common functionality like e.g. sending web requests, so it is not necessary to re-invent the wheel all the time.
This is great! This saves a lot of work, time and money, and usually when a library is widely used, it is rock stable."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://jugmac00.github.io/blog/oh-open-source-supply-chain-security-where-art-thou/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.96771a12b249af1ff464eabdaa85d1a5268a4379a9f2da62cfd409656ff0233b.css integrity="sha256-lncaErJJrx/0ZOq9qoXRpSaKQ3mp8tpiz9QJZW/wIzs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.f413e19d0714851f6474e7ee9632408e58ac146fbdbe62747134bea2fa3415e0.js integrity="sha256-9BPhnQcUhR9kdOfuljJAjlisFG+9vmJ0cTS+ovo0FeA=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://jugmac00.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://jugmac00.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://jugmac00.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://jugmac00.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://jugmac00.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--hljs-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="Oh Open Source Supply Chain Security, Where Art Thou?"><meta property="og:description" content="&ldquo;This is horrifying.

Most applications nowadays use open source libraries, especially for common functionality like e.g. sending web requests, so it is not necessary to re-invent the wheel all the time.\nThis is great! This saves a lot of work, time and money, and usually when a library is widely used, it is rock stable.\nWhat could possibly go wrong? There are just too many moving parts, so it is almost impossible to make sure the software you are using is really safe.\nThink of the many different maintainers that are involved.\nDo they all have good intentions?\nAre their computers safe?\nAre all of their accounts safe? Are they using 2FA?\nAre the tools they are using really safe? e.g. coverage or CI?\nAnd while many popular libraries are closely watched, maybe backed by some companies, maybe maintained by experienced software engineers, what about their transitive dependencies?\nTransitive what? Seth Michael Larson, core maintainer of urllib3, currently second most downloaded Python package, wrote a blog post to make aware of that issue.\nIn a diagram he shows the requests package, its maintainer, but also the dependencies of requests, ie. urllib3, idna and chardet, and their maintainers.\nWhen you depend on requests, and requests depends on urllib3, then urllib3 is a transitive dependency, which you need to install to use requests.\nOh look who’s there When I had a look at the diagram, I immediately noticed one of the maintainers of chardet, as he is one of my “Python friends”. I do not publish the name / account until I receive his permission to do so. Until then, you need to guess which one it is :-)\nBoom When I asked him on Twitter whether that is him… he said “No.”\nBut in fact he is - I checked the maintainers list on PyPI.\nHaving a look at the contributors of chardet on Github via git shortlog --summary --numbered --email, I had to swallow hard, this time he is not trolling me, he did not contribute a single line.\nLet that sink in.\nYou have access to the PyPI account of a top 50 library, which actually is also a dependency of a top 3 Python package, and you are not aware of it.\nThere were quite some supply chain issues out there, but currently I cannot imagine anything close to this one!\nImagine Last week there was a lot of buzz about someone “hacking a popular PyPI package” called ctx, where PyPI administrators estimated 27.000 downloads in 10 days.\nOk, got a seat? Let’s have a look at how many downloads chardet and requests have.\nAccording to https://pepy.tech/...\n requests: 50 million per day chardet: 15 million per day  Is it safe to use open source software? According to Dustin Ingram’s 2022 PyCon US talk Securing the Open Source Software Supply Chain…\nYes!\n… with a giant asterisk :-)\nWhat can we do? I would suggest to watch both of Dustin’s talks as a starter:\n Secure Software Supply Chains for Python Securing the Open Source Software Supply Chain  I also highly recommend Seth’s blog posts:\n Security for package maintainers People in your software supply chain  And in case you are a professional software developer, ask yourself:\n“What can my company do to make open source software even safer?”\nPictures  “this is fine” by kcg “mic drop” from Wikimedia  ","wordCount":"591","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-06-01T20:38:46+02:00","dateModified":"2022-06-01T20:38:46+02:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://jugmac00.github.io/blog/oh-open-source-supply-chain-security-where-art-thou/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jürgen Gmach","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://jugmac00.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://jugmac00.github.io accesskey=h title="Jürgen Gmach (Alt + H)">Jürgen Gmach</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://jugmac00.github.io/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jugmac00.github.io/blog/ title=blog><span>blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jugmac00.github.io/til/ title=til><span>today-i-learned</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jugmac00.github.io/talks/ title=talks><span>talks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jugmac00.github.io/hiring/ title=hiring><span>hiring</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jugmac00.github.io/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Oh Open Source Supply Chain Security, Where Art Thou?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title="2022-06-01 20:38:46 +0200 +0200">June 1, 2022</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>&ldquo;This is horrifying.
