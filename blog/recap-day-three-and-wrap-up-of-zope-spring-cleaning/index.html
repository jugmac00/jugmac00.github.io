  <p>This blog post is work in progess... much more to come - but the train is only 10 minutes late (uncommon in Germany :-) ) , so I am not able finish the blog post now.</p>
<h2>tl/dr - what a ride!</h2>
<ul>
<li>today there was the final release of Zope 4! see <a href="https://blog.gocept.com/2019/05/10/celebration-zope-4-final-release/">blog post @gocept</a></li>
<li>Michael / @gocept announced the <a href="https://blog.gocept.com/2019/05/10/zope-roadmap/">roadmap</a> for Zope 2.13, Zope 4 and Zope 5</li>
</ul>
<h2>progress on day 3</h2>
<p>The main effort of everybody at the sprint was to wrap up all loose ends, finalize what one started, and of course get Zope 4 final released!</p>
<p>As there was no final standup, I try to list what I picked up...</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael<ul>
<li>finish and publish the above mentioned blog posts</li>
<li>trying to not get lost with those massive incoming GitHub updates</li>
<li>preparing and finally publishing the release of Zope 4</li>
<li>had a deeper look into the "allowed attributes" ticket together with Steffen; a safe last minute fix was not possible</li>
<li>even found time to review some open pull requests and to give me a helping hand for a test setup</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jeremy<ul>
<li>finished enabling <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/zc.recipe.testrunner/pull/3">support for Python 3</a> for the zc.recipe.testrunner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steffen<ul>
<li>made up his mind about <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/617">how to improve the speed for the Windows tests</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Daniel<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Jens Klein<ul>
<li>updated <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/608">ZODB migration story</a></li>
<li>oh noes! announced the news that <strong>Plone</strong> - for some cases - can't yet use <strong>Zope 4</strong> - info came from Philip Bauer, cf <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/610">ticket "allowed attributes"</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jens Hinghaus<ul>
<li>got his pull request merged for <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/605">fixing the ZMI serarch bug</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jürgen<ul>
<li>update <a href="https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zdgbook/ObjectPublishing.html#xml-rpc">section about XML-RPC</a> of the Zope developer's guide, which also was the last section of Chapter 4 - which I started updating a whopping 8 months ago!!</li>
<li>started working on Chapter 5 <a href="https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zdgbook/Products.html">Zope Products</a></li>
<li>....</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, Jens Vagelpohl, Marius and Dieter and maybe some more guys I possibly missed, supported the sprint massively from remote!</p>
