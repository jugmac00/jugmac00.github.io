In order to contribute to the project, you need to sign a contributor’s agreement.\ndevelopment process Once your application has been accepted, which is a mere formality, you may to start contributing.\nwhere to find the source code Zope and all its related packages, which reside under the umbrella of the Zope Foundation, are hosted at GitHub.\nFor instance, the repository for Zope is located at https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope\nNote  There are plans to merge the Zope Foundation into the Plone Foundation - current status is unknown (As of 2021, the Zope Foundation is a proud member of the Plone Foundation. Source code repositories are not affected by this merger.).\n development flow Though not 100% consistent, usually you cannot and you should not directly work on the master branch.\nThe recommended way is to clone the repository and work on a new branch.\nOnce finished, push your branch to the repository and create a pull request. Both your branch and the pull request will get automatically tested by TravisCI (see below) (As of 2021, this is GHA).\nMost repositories need both green tests and a successful review before a pull request gets merged.\nUsually you will merge the branch yourself - in order to show off that you have signed the contributor agreement.\nAfter the pull request has been merged, please delete your branch.\nNote  If you want to implement very small changes - e.g. fixing typos - you can directly edit the file in your browser by clicking the pencil icon when viewing the file on GitHub.com.\n tests It is highly recommended that all code changes, bug fixes and new features should be tested by automatic tests.\nUnlike most other Python projects, Zope/universe hardly makes use of pytest - which can be both quite surprising and a bit of a hurdle.\nZope/universe favors the zope.testrunner.\nsupported python versions For Zope 4/universe we support Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, for Zope 5 support for Python 2.7 and 3.5 was dropped. There is certainly support for Python 3.9 (in wide parts! with the exception of ZEO).\nThis roughly reflects the officially supported Python versions.\nSome packages also support PyPy.\nIn order to configure the supported Python versions, but also much more, we developed the meta config tool.\nupdates 2021.05.10\n update information to reflect current state remove section about Travis  2019.05.03\n update what makes it hard to start contributing to Zope; also add links  2019.05.04\n add section about support Python versions  2019.05.06\n add link to a very concise tox introduction  2019.05.08\n update TravisCI trouble shooting section  ","wordCount":"559","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2019-05-03T12:48:11+02:00","dateModified":"2019-05-03T12:48:11+02:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://jugmac00.github.io/blog/face-to-face-with-earl-zope/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jürgen Gmach","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://jugmac00.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:#1d1e20;--entry:#2e2e33;--primary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg:#2e2e33;--code-bg:#37383e;--border:#333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://jugmac00.github.io accesskey=h title="Jürgen Gmach (Alt + H)">Jürgen Gmach</a>
