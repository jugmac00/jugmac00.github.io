<p>This blog post tries to ease beginning and keeping up with development of the open source web application server <a href="https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Zope</a> and its universe.</p>
<h2>what makes it hard to start contributing to Zope</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zope</strong> is a very mature product, as it was launched already back in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zope">1999</a></li>
<li><strong>Zope</strong> underwent some major architectural changes (keyword <a href="http://muthukadan.net/docs/zca.html#introduction">ZCA</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Zope</strong> itself is relatively complex</li>
<li>there is also a complex ecosystem around it<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/">Buildout</a></li>
<li><a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation">GitHub.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tox</a> / <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-tox">quick introduction</a></li>
<li><a href="https://zopetestrunner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">zope.testrunner</a></li>
<li><a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a></li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>documentation is partially out of date (but there is an effort to fix this)</li>
<li>there are many developers which contribute for years, or even more than a decade, not many new developers</li>
<li>there are many <strong>unwritten</strong> rules</li>
</ul>
<h2>prerequisites</h2>
<p><strong>Zope</strong> and probably the most of its related packages are licensed under the <a href="https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:ZPL-2.1">ZPL</a>. In order to contribute to the project, you need to sign a <a href="http://docs.zope.org/developer/becoming-a-committer.html">contributor's agreement</a>. If you do not get a reply to your application in a reasonable amount of time, please resend your email.</p>
<h2>development process</h2>
<p>Once your application has been accepted, which is a mere formality, you may to start contributing.</p>
<h3>where to find the source code</h3>
<p>Zope and all its related packages, which reside under the umbrella of the Zope Foundation, are hosted at <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, the repository for Zope is located at <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope">https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope</a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong>  There are plans to merge the Zope Foundation into the <a href="https://plone.org/foundation">Plone Foundation</a> - current status is unknown.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>flow</h3>
<p>Though not 100% consistent, usually you cannot and you should not directly work on the master branch.</p>
<p>The recommended way is to clone the repository and work on a new branch.</p>
<p>Once finished, push your branch to the repository and create a pull request. Both your branch and the pull request will get automatically tested by TravisCI (see below).</p>
<p>Most repositories need both green tests and a successful review before a pull request gets merged.</p>
<p>Usually you will merge the branch yourself - in order to show off that you have signed the contributor agreement.</p>
<p>After the pull request had been merged, please delete your branch.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> If you want to implement very small changes - e.g. fixing typos - you can directly edit the file in your browser by clicking the pencil icon when viewing the file on GitHub.com.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>tests</h3>
<p>It is highly recommended that all code changes, bug fixes and new features should be tested by automatic tests.</p>
<p>Unlike most other Python projects, <strong>Zope/universe</strong> does not make use of pytest - which can be both quite surprising and a bit of a hurdle.</p>
<p><strong>Zope/universe</strong> makes heavily use of <a href="https://pypi.org/project/zope.testrunner/">zope.testrunner</a>.</p>
<h3>supported python versions</h3>
<p>Currently, Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 (dev) are supported for most of the <strong>Zope 4/universe</strong> packages. This reflects the officially supported Python versions.</p>
<p>Some packages also support <a href="https://pypy.org/">PyPy</a>.</p>
<p>Afaik, there are plans to drop support for Python 2.7 with Zope 5.</p>
<p>When adding support for a new Python version, or dropping support for an old one, you have to update several files:</p>
<ul>
<li>.travis.yml</li>
<li>tox.ini</li>
<li>setup.py</li>
<li>CHANGES.rst</li>
</ul>
<h3>continuous integration - mostly via travisci</h3>
<p>Whenever you push to a branch or make a pull request, <a href="https://travis-ci.org">TravisCI</a> automatically pulls your changes and runs the project's test suite.</p>
<p>This is configured via a <strong>.travis.yml</strong> file at root level of the repository.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong>  For packages, which should be supported on the Windows plattform, <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> gets used.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>travisci configuration</h3>
<p>The configuration for TravisCI changes on quite a regular basis. There are OS upgrades, new and deprecated Python versions, syntax changes and also new and deprecated features for Travis itself.</p>
<p>Depending on how the tests are run, whether there are checks for styles or coverage, the <strong>.travis.yml</strong> can be quite different for different packages.</p>
<p>You can have a look at the recently updated configuration for <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/zExceptions/blob/master/.travis.yml">zExceptions</a> as a good example with up-to-date best practices.</p>
<h3>deprecated travisci configuration</h3>
<p>If you happen to see a <strong>sudo: false/true</strong> option in a <strong>.travis.yml</strong> file, you can safely remove it (cf. <a href="https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-11-19-required-linux-infrastructure-migration">https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-11-19-required-linux-infrastructure-migration</a>).</p>
<h3>travisci trouble shooting</h3>
<ul>
<li>flaky tests - sometimes tests fail for <strong>no reason</strong> - you can try to dig deeper or just re-run the build by clicking the "rebuild" button on the TravisCI website.</li>
<li>bad cache =&gt; clear cache - rarely this is necessary; a re-run should do the job most of the time - please find more information at the <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching/#clearing-caches">TravisCI documentation site</a>.</li>
</ul>
