  <p>There is something I immediately disliked when using Fedora the first time - the Bash prompt.</p>
<p>For many years I've been using a fixed prompt at work for all my machines, a beauty in green and yellow...</p>
<p>And when I first started Bash after installing Fedora on my home laptop, I encountered this grey monotony...</p>
<pre><code>[jugmac00@localhost ~]$
</code></pre>
<p>I did not try to recreate the prompt I have at work, but I wanted to try something new - and <em>oh my zsh</em>, ah, <em>oh my god</em>,  <strong>zsh</strong> did not come to my mind - yuck!</p>
<h2>the good (looking prompt and statusline)</h2>
<p>Instead, while googling for resources about Fedora, I stumbled upon <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/add-power-terminal-powerline/">Add power to your terminal with powerline</a> published on <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/">https://fedoramagazine.org/</a>.</p>
<p>From <strong>Powerline's</strong> <a href="https://github.com/powerline/powerline">GitHub page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Powerline is a statusline plugin for vim, and provides statuslines and prompts for several other applications, including zsh, bash, fish, tmux, IPython, Awesome, i3 and Qtile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article is written very well, and easy to follow. A few minutes later, installing a few packages here, adding some lines to <em>.bashrc</em> and <em>.vim.rc</em> there, both <strong>Bash</strong> and <strong>Vim</strong> looked great!</p>

<h3>vim</h3>

<h2>the bad (experience)</h2>
<p>The wow-effect lasted only a couple of minutes, until I tried to work on a Python project.</p>
<p>When you work on a Python project, it's an hell of an idea to use <strong>virtualenv</strong> instead of installing dependencies system wide.</p>
<p>From <strong>virtualenv's</strong> <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/">documentation page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in order to not mess up with Python based Linux applications - such as <strong>Powerline</strong> - I activated the virtualenv for my project, started <strong>Vim</strong>... and it made booooom!</p>

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'powerline'
An error occurred while importing powerline module.
This could be caused by invalid sys.path setting,
or by an incompatible Python version (powerline requires
Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2 and later to work). Please consult
the troubleshooting section in the documentation for
possible solutions.
Unable to import powerline, is it installed?

<p>As a Python developer I am used to see tracebacks, so I was not scared away immediately, and this traceback was even a very informative one:</p>
<pre><code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'powerline'
</code></pre>
<p>In order to verify the <em>missing</em> package, I left <strong>Vim</strong> and started a Python interpreter and tried to import the <strong>Powerline</strong> package manually...</p>
<ul>
<li>one time without activated <strong>virtualenv</strong><pre><code>jugmac00 ~&gt; python3.6
Python 3.6.5 (default, Mar 29 2018, 18:20:46) 
[GCC 8.0.1 20180317 (Red Hat 8.0.1-0.19)] on linux

&gt;&gt;&gt; import powerline
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>the other with activated <strong>virtualenv</strong><pre><code>jugmac00 ~&gt; python3.6
Python 3.6.5 (default, Mar 29 2018, 18:20:46) 
[GCC 8.0.1 20180317 (Red Hat 8.0.1-0.19)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import powerline
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'powerline'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we go! Having a look at the longish traceback from above again, I also spotted the exact location of the problem, the import statement in <em>.vimrc</em>.</p>
<pre><code>python3 from powerline.vim import setup as powerline_setup
python3 powerline_setup()
python3 del powerline_setup
</code></pre>
<p>There are <em>only</em> two Python 3 interpreters on my system (that I know of)</p>
<ul>
<li>the standard one</li>
<li>the one in my project's virtualenv</li>
</ul>
<p>So obviously, <strong>Vim</strong> is using my project's environment - instead of the system one!</p>
<h2>the ugly (hack)</h2>
<p>Two possible solutions came to my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>installing powerline into my virtualenv (<em>oh my zsh</em>, ah, <em>oh my god</em> - how could I even think of it? :-))</li>
<li>manipulating the Python path</li>
</ul>
<p>As the few lines of code from above suggest, it seems to be possible to write ordinary Python code within <em>.vimrc</em>.</p>
<p>But where is <strong>Powerline's</strong> Python package?</p>
<p>Say <em>hello</em> to Python's ability for introspection...</p>
<pre><code>jugmac00 ~&gt; python3
Python 3.6.5 (default, Mar 29 2018, 18:20:46) 
[GCC 8.0.1 20180317 (Red Hat 8.0.1-0.19)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import powerline
&gt;&gt;&gt; powerline.__path__
['/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/powerline']
</code></pre>
<p>So I just had to add the following line to <em>.vimrc</em>:</p>
<pre><code>python3 import sys;sys.path.append("/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/")
</code></pre>
<p>And here we go, <strong>Powerline</strong> and <strong>Vim</strong>, united once again - and this time, even when using an activated <strong>virtualenv</strong>.</p>
<h3>drawback</h3>
<p>Adding system-wide site-packages could have some unforseen side effects, but at least it only effects <strong>Vim</strong>, and not my project. And, well... yolo :-)</p>
<h3>bug report</h3>
<p>Googling for the error message did not reveal much more information about this problem. But at least I found a <a href="https://github.com/powerline/powerline/issues/1908">bug report</a> at <strong>Powerline's</strong> issue tracker - yet without an answer.</p>
<p>Lately, <strong>Powerline's</strong> development seems to be not that active anyway, and to be honest, I am not sure, whether this is a <strong>Powerline</strong> or maybe even a <strong>Vim</strong> bug.</p>
