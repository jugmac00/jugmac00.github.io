In Germany the corona numbers go through the roof,
many school classes are already under quarantine,
so there is no more time to waste and I need to setup a laptop for my son.

I still own a 2012 [Samsung 900X4D A02DE](https://www.samsung.com/de/support/model/NP900X4D-A02DE/),
which after upgrading RAM and SSD still works decently.

As the laptop has no CD drive,
I need to setup a USB stick to install a new operating system.

You probably want a decently fast stick with at least 4 GB free space on it.

While the laptop initially came with Windows 7,
in the meanwhile I mostly ran Fedora.

As my son is only in the first grade,
he has not yet learned English in school,
so I need to set up an operating system with German language.

Ubuntu is my favorite operating system,
and as I run it on my laptop,
I can use the "Startup Disk Creator" which comes pre-installed with Ubuntu.

The app is super simple:
- choose an ISO image
- choose the destination = USB stick

Just click on "Make Startup Disk" and wait a couple of minutes.

## Thanks

Thanks to the [maintainers](https://launchpad.net/usb-creator) of this super simple,
but nonetheless valuable tool!
