Especially in English texts...

I am no native English speaker,
and there are so many subtleties in the English language,
so when I was about to prepare my lightning talk submissions for both PyOhio and PyCon US,
I was super happy that my friend [Miroslav ≈†ediv√Ω](https://twitter.com/eumiro) sent me the following link:

https://capitalizemytitle.com/

At this site you can just paste your heading's text,
and you receive it properly capitalized,
even in different styles, e.g. APA, Chicago, AP, MLA...
and many more.


P.S.: When I showed the final result to my friends Miroslav and [Oliver](https://twitter.com/obestwalter),
I certainly got a big VETO! üßêü•≥

P.P.S.: I just learned: "There are no fixed rules for headings except for `tox`!" Oliver Bestwalter
