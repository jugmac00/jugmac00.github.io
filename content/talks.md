Since 2018, I have given many talks at many occasions.
I especially enjoy giving lightning and thunder talks.

I want to thank both the **Google Developer Group** in Regensburg and
**Python Ireland** for giving me a chance to become a more experienced speaker.

  I walk through the amazing `all-repos` command line app, and show how to search and grep
  in many repositories, and finally, how to apply changes to all of them.
