So, let&amp;rsquo;s get the terminology straight.
Conda&amp;hellip; what? Conda Conda is a CLI application which does package, dependency and environment management, not only for Python, but also for other languages.
Anaconda Anaconda is an open-source Python distribution platform.
This is the all-in-one package, containing not only the Conda application, but already many packages which you usually need for a data science project.</description></item></channel></rss>
