After launching my first container, I wanted to ssh into it, but was not successful.
Basically, now you have two ways to find out what is going on.
Run the ssh command again with -v, so you see more output.
ssh -v user@host The other choice is to go into the container and start the ssh server in debug mode.</description></item><item><title>How to Audit and Harden an SSH Client</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-audit-and-harden-an-ssh-client/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 11:30:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-audit-and-harden-an-ssh-client/</guid><description>You probably know how to harden an SSH server, or at least heard of it.

step 1 - auditing your SSH client terminal 1 git clone https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit cd ssh-audit python3.8 ssh-audit.py -c # c = client audit; this starts a ssh server on port 2222 terminal 2 ssh localhost -p 2222 Now, switch back to terminal 1 and have a look at the output - it all should be green - but it won&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item></channel></rss>
