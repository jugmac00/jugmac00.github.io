Why would you want a less secure web server?
Well, maybe you have to support older clients.
e.g. IE 11 on Windows 8.1 or Java 7 (cough) cannot connect to a web server, which only uses modern and secure ciphers.
From a Java application, which cannot be updated, but has to work, I got the following exception:
Exception in thread &amp;#34;main&amp;#34; javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure at sun.</description></item><item><title>How to Audit and Harden an SSH Client</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-audit-and-harden-an-ssh-client/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 11:30:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-audit-and-harden-an-ssh-client/</guid><description>You probably know how to harden an SSH server, or at least heard of it.
e.g. do not offer weak ciphers, or do not allow root login&amp;hellip;
But did you know you can and also should harden your SSH client?
step 1 - auditing your SSH client terminal 1 git clone https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit cd ssh-audit python3.8 ssh-audit.py -c # c = client audit; this starts a ssh server on port 2222 terminal 2 ssh localhost -p 2222 Now, switch back to terminal 1 and have a look at the output - it all should be green - but it won&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item></channel></rss>
