While I am not entirely sure, and I have some vague memories about potential problems with RestrictedPython, I can certainly grep the almost 300 Zope repositories for signs of PyPy support.
The best sign of PyPy support is IMHO that we run tests for it :-)
In order to grep in all repositories I use all-repos written by Anthony Sottile.</description></item><item><title>How to Access via WebDav</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-access-via-webdav/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 13:26:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-access-via-webdav/</guid><description>WebDav is a protocol, based on top of HTTP, that allows clients remote content authoring, such as creating, editing and deleting content.
The protocol itself is pretty old, dating back to the late 90ies.
While not really popular, even modern systems like NextCloud, OwnCloud, and also the widely-used NAS systems by Synology do support this standard - and also Zope!
How to activate WebDav support in Zope? The WebDav support in Zope had been temporarily removed, as Zope switched from the legacy ZServer to the standard WSGI approach, and WebDav was coupled to the ZServer, for no obvious reasons.</description></item><item><title>How to Develop Dependencies With Buildout</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-develop-dependencies-with-buildout/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2020 13:33:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-develop-dependencies-with-buildout/</guid><description>Given you have a decent sized project, with some dependencies&amp;hellip;
How can you develop and test a dependency against your main project, when it is not yet published on PyPi?
Well, until recently, I relied on a strong test suite and mostly developed &amp;ldquo;blindly&amp;rdquo;.
When I wanted to see the result, I used Vim to directly edit the dependency in my virtual env.
There must be a better way And actually, there is and has been for more than a decade.</description></item><item><title>How to Run a Single Test</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-run-a-single-test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 13:37:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-run-a-single-test/</guid><description>While this seems to be no Zope specific question, as we all know how to narrow down the test selection with pytest (e.g. pytest -k pattern), Zope does not use pytest, but zope.testrunner.
Similar to pytest, also zope.testrunner offers some command line options, see https://zopetestrunner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#some-useful-command-line-options-to-get-you-started
This means, in order to run a specific test, you can use the -t flag, which takes one or more regex expressions as input, e.g. -t some_test.</description></item></channel></rss>
