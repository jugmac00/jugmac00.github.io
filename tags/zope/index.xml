While I am not entirely sure, and I have some vague memories about potential problems with RestrictedPython, I can certainly grep the almost 300 Zope repositories for signs of PyPy support.
The best sign of PyPy support is IMHO that we run tests for it :-)
In order to grep in all repositories I use all-repos written by Anthony Sottile.</description></item><item><title>How to Access via WebDav</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-access-via-webdav/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 13:26:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-access-via-webdav/</guid><description>WebDav is a protocol, based on top of HTTP, that allows clients remote content authoring, such as creating, editing and deleting content.
The protocol itself is pretty old, dating back to the late 90ies.
While not really popular, even modern systems like NextCloud, OwnCloud, and also the widely-used NAS systems by Synology do support this standard - and also Zope!
How to activate WebDav support in Zope? The WebDav support in Zope had been temporarily removed, as Zope switched from the legacy ZServer to the standard WSGI approach, and WebDav was coupled to the ZServer, for no obvious reasons.</description></item></channel></rss>
