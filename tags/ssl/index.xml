Why would you want a less secure web server?
Well, maybe you have to support older clients.
e.g. IE 11 on Windows 8.1 or Java 7 (cough) cannot connect to a web server, which only uses modern and secure ciphers.
From a Java application, which cannot be updated, but has to work, I got the following exception:
Exception in thread &amp;#34;main&amp;#34; javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure at sun.</description></item><item><title>How to Check the Expiry Date of an SSL/TLS Certificate</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-check-the-expiry-date-of-ssl-certificate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 11:37:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-check-the-expiry-date-of-ssl-certificate/</guid><description>For a couple of years now, I use the fantastic (and free*) service by Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt in order to generate SSL/TLS certificates.
One of the main differences to paid certs is that the ones of Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt are only valid 90 days.
This sounds bad at first, but actually this is a good thing from a security perspective, and anyway, you do not create / renew certs manually, but one of the many clients do this for you automatically.</description></item></channel></rss>
