It is one of the many tools, implemented in Rust, which offer some more features compared to their bash alternatives.
What about no When I tried to install it, I just saw the following error message:
❯ cargo install lfs Updating crates.io index Downloaded lfs v2.6.0 error: failed to parse manifest at `/home/jugmac00/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/lfs-2.6.0/Cargo.toml` Caused by: feature `strip` is required The package requires the Cargo feature called `strip`, but that feature is not stabilized in this version of Cargo (1.</description></item><item><title>How to Cargo Install a Package With Additional Features</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-cargo-install-a-package-with-additional-features/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 08:04:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-cargo-install-a-package-with-additional-features/</guid><description>Meanwhile you may have heard that there are a couple of new CLI apps out there written in Rust - blazing fast and with additional features.
While I rarely use them, as I do not want to get used to tools, which are not available on all Linux machines I work on, I do use ripgrep regularly, as it really makes a difference, especially in speed.
Yesterday, I wanted to use ripgrep with PCRE2 (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions), but when I tried it, I got this error message:</description></item><item><title>How to Update All Installed Rust Packages</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-update-all-installed-rust-packages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 11:10:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-update-all-installed-rust-packages/</guid><description>Rust is not only known for its memory safety, but also for being (almost) on par with C, speed-wise.
In the last couple of years quite some interesting tools were created, which may replace common Linux command line tools, e.g. bat instead of cat, ripgrep instead of grep, &amp;hellip;
