This means, e.g. in a Jinja template a string like Conference has to be transformed into {{ _('Conference') }}.
This is a very tedious work, so I created a shortcut for it.
Add the following lines to your keybindings.json:
&amp;quot;key&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ctrl+shift+alt+0&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;command&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;editor.action.insertSnippet&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;when&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;editorHasSelection || editorHasMultipleSelections&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;args&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;snippet&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;{{ _('${TM_SELECTED_TEXT}') }}&amp;quot; } I used &amp;ldquo;ctrl+shift+alt+0&amp;rdquo; as on keyboard with a German layout the closing curly brace is on the same key as the 0.</description></item><item><title>How to Globally Gitignore Configuration Files</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-globally-gitignore-configuration-files/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 08:51:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-globally-gitignore-configuration-files/</guid><description>Until today, I did not make up my mind about what to do with configuration files, created by e.g. VS Code.
Certainly, I do not want to commit them, but putting it into every&amp;rsquo;s repository .gitignore file is also cumbersome - and sometimes it is not possible.
I always do a git add -u to avoid accidentally adding a venv or similar, so it did not really matter.

There is not much source code in the repository, but a lot of build artifacts get generated by it.
I am using VS Code now for quite a while, and especially for this one repository, and I never noticed problems, until recently.
As most of the time extensions are the cause for problems, the VS Code team even provides a kind of bisecting mechanism to help find faulty plugins.</description></item><item><title>How to Count Number of Selected Lines in Vscode</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-count-number-of-selected-lines-in-vscode/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 13:10:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-count-number-of-selected-lines-in-vscode/</guid><description>Today I wrote a CSV export with many, many columns, where in my Python code each column was calculated on a single line.

Due to &amp;ldquo;legacy issues&amp;rdquo;, I had to apply many # noinspection annotations to my source code.
Now, that I switched to VS Code, I want to get rid of actually 821 # noinspection annotations :-)
A simple search for # noinspection.* and a replacement with basically nothing would work, but that would leave behind many blank lines.</description></item><item><title>How to Deactivate Auto Import in Pylance</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-deactivate-auto-import-in-pylance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 09:14:02 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-deactivate-auto-import-in-pylance/</guid><description>Unfortunately, the auto-import feature in PyLance surprised me with random imports.
e.g. with from unittest.case import expectedFailure just when I typed assert result == expected.
Luckily, the developers listened to the users, and with version 2020.8.0 this &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; is optional.
In order to deactivate it, set the following option to false:

Until recently you usually declared the security for a method like this&amp;hellip;
from AccessControl import getSecurityManager class Suggestions(SomeBaseClass): security = ClassSecurityInfo() security.declareProtected(&amp;#34;View&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;all_suggestions&amp;#34;) def all_suggestions(): ... Then, when accessing this method, e.g. the logged in user&amp;rsquo;s role or group was checked against the security declaration.
One big disadvantage was that you could easily introduce typos.</description></item></channel></rss>
