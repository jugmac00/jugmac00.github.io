Working with branches is fine, as long as you are able to work on one only, or at least have the time to wrap up your work and commit some self-contained and complete state before switching to the next branch.
If you cannot complete your work, it gets messy.
Now, you can either
use git stash create a work-in-progress(WIP) commit just keep the modified or new files, and try to work around them and to not commit them by accident git clone your repository into another directory I have done all of them, and they all have their downsides.</description></item></channel></rss>
