Long running as of 30 minutes. The script goes through all our servers and deploys the latest changes.
Needless to say that it would not be optimal when e.g. the connection dies during the deployment, as this would stop the deployment right in the middle.

In order to find out what exactly happened, I needed to compare both the tip of the git and the Bazaar repository.
Turns out, diff can not only compare files, but also directories&amp;hellip; recursively!

A build process failed - on one machine, but not on the other.
Identical setup - of course :-/
The build script consists of a bash script, which wraps a call to the C binary.
The bash script was innocent.
When I had a closer look at the C source code, it turned out there were about 30 lines of code, just dealing with traversing directories and copying files and folders.</description></item><item><title>How Can You Convert an Adobe Illustrator File (AI) to an Encapsulated Postscript File (eps)</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-can-you-convert-an-adobe-illustrator-file-to-an-encapsulated-postscript-file/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2021 22:23:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-can-you-convert-an-adobe-illustrator-file-to-an-encapsulated-postscript-file/</guid><description>One of my web applications is using RML to render PDFs.
For one PDF document template I received a new logo file which was produced with Adobe Illustrator (file extension .ai).
The RML library cannot handle ai-files, but eps-files.
In order to convert the file I used Ghostscript as following:
gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=eps2write -sOutputFile=out.eps input.ai where
-dNOPAUSE means &amp;ldquo;no pause after page&amp;rdquo; -dBATCH means &amp;ldquo;exit after last file&amp;rdquo; -sDEVICE selects the device -sOutputFile is the name of the - you can guess it - output file P.</description></item><item><title>How to Sort Files and Folders in Nautilus So Folders Are Shown First</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-sort-files-and-folders-in-nautilus-so-folders-are-shown-first/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 09:07:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-sort-files-and-folders-in-nautilus-so-folders-are-shown-first/</guid><description>update settings gsettings set org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser sort-directories-first true check settings gsettings get org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser sort-directories-first via https://askubuntu.com/questions/1064482/</description></item></channel></rss>
