`launchpad-mojo-specs &amp;lt;https://code.launchpad.net/launchpad-mojo-specs&amp;gt;` This is reStructuredText - a file format for structured data. While many people have switched to MarkDown, which is unarguably easier to read and write, I still like reStructuredText as it is very powerful.
The above link does not get rendered as a hyperlink, as it misses a trailing underscore.
I was about to add it, and directly commit, but luckily I tried to render it first.</description></item><item><title>How to Delete Documentation Hosted on pythonhosted.org</title><link>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-delete-documentation-hosted-on-pythonhosted-dot-org/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 16:29:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jugmac00.github.io/til/how-to-delete-documentation-hosted-on-pythonhosted-dot-org/</guid><description>Today, I needed to lookup something in the documentation of lazr.config, which - you guessed it - is a configuration system, using an ini-like configuration file format.
The number one search result on Google is still https://pythonhosted.org/lazr.config/.
For projects on available on PyPI both wheels and packages are hosted on pythonhosted.org, and as it looks, at least before &amp;ldquo;my time&amp;rdquo; and before there was Read the Docs, also documentation was hosted on pythonhosted.</description></item></channel></rss>
