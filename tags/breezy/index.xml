For a long time, Bazaar was the only supported VCS on Launchpad.
Launchpad is a code hosting platform, similar to the now prevalent GitHub, and while open to the public, nowadays it is mostly used by Canonical itself and many other individuals and companys to manage the whole lifecycle of creating packages for Ubuntu and its distributions.
Since quite some time also git is a supported VCS on Launchpad.</description></item></channel></rss>
